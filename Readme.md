1)Knowing the IP address
<br>
<br>
It works on the tcp protocol .
<br>
<br>
Turn Servers are the servers helps to get  the public IP address of the computer for connection.
<br>
<br>
2)Signalling
<br>
<br>
SDP is the id , which contains all the details regarding the user computer which is needed to be transferred to the computer we're trying to connect .The sdp is send through the node server.
<br>
<br>
3)It follows P2P architecture.
<br>
<br>
Drawback
<br>
<br>
1)It can connect only two people.
<br>
<br>
1) We follow SFU architecture.(Selective forwarding Unit).
<br>
<br>
SFU could refer to Selective Forwarding Unit, which is a server that acts as a media router in video calls. It's located between the participants in a call, and all participants securely connect to it. The SFU then decides which video and audio to send to each participant.
