1)Knowing the IP address
It works on the tcp protocol .
Turn Servers are the servers helps to get  the public IP address of the computer for connection.
2)Signalling
SDP is the id , which contains all the details regarding the user computer which is needed to be transferred to the computer we're trying to connect .The sdp is send through the node server.
3)It follows P2P architecture.

Drawback
1)It can connect only two people.


1) We follow SFU architecture.(Selective forwarding Unit).
SFU could refer to Selective Forwarding Unit, which is a server that acts as a media router in video calls. It's located between the participants in a call, and all participants securely connect to it. The SFU then decides which video and audio to send to each participant.
